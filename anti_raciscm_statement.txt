We denounce racism, intollerance, injustice, and oppression of any form. We affirm that Black Lives Matter and acknowledge that racial injustice is pervasive throughout this country as well as the halls of higher education and research. We commit to actively seeking to create a supportive and respectful environment and to actively fight against and oppose intollerance in all aspects of our work at Berkeley and beyond. We pledge to continue to educate ourselves and to hold each other accountable. No person is free of predjudice and we view this is a statement of intent that we will strive to continuosly improve, advocate, and learn with and from each other.
