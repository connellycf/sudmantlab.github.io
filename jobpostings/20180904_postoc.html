Postdoc:UCBerkeley.Genomics

Postdoctoral position(s) on the genomics and evolution of cellular and organismal diversity, aging, and stress available. 

The Sudmant Lab at UC Berkeley uses computational, statistical, and experimental methods to interrogate genetic and molecular phenotypic diversity at both the organismal and cellular level. We are particularly interested in studying the causes and consequences of stress and aging in organisms with a focus on post-transcriptional gene regulation, somatic mutation, and genetic adaption in long (and short) lived species. Other topics of interest include population genetics and human diveristy of copy number variation.

A multi-year postdoctoral position is available (initial 12-month appointment renewable up to four more years). Start date is flexible. 

We are seeking both experimental and computation postdoctoral applicants with a wide range of interests and expertise, however, specific/ongoing questions/projects include:

1) Quantify the impact of aging on the fidelity of post-transcriptional gene regulatory processes in different cellular and tissue contexts using vertebrate models including the mouse and killifish and high-throughput genomic profiling techniques such as ribosome profiling, RNAseq and single cell technologies.

2) Determine how age-associated somatic mutations accumulate in a cell-type specific fashion using single cell genome sequencing technologies in vertebrate models with a focus on strucural variant formation.

3) High-quality Pac-Bio genome assembly of long-lived rockfish species genomes and dissection of structural genomic features, population genetics, and selective signatures.

4) Cellular engineering and CRISPR based QTL-mapping/screening of mutational mechanisms in different genetic backgrounds, cell types, and cell lines derived from individuals of different ages.

5) Development of novel computational methods to identify and quantify somatic mutations and signatures of DNA damage

6) Computational population genetics assessment of selective signatures of antagonistic pleiotropy in human and non-human populations  

Required qualifications:

Ph.D. or equivalent in genetics, genomics, biology, computer science or related fields and demonstrated record of productivity and publications. Experience with either generating or analyzing large-scale genomic data.

Please contact Peter with your CV and a brief overview of the research program / questions you are interested in pursuing in our lab as well as PDFs of recent relevent publications. Please be prepared to provide scientific references (e.g. advisor / thesis committee members). The position is open until filled with an anticipated start date late 2018 or early 2019.
