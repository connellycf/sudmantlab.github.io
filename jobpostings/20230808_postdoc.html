Postdoc:UCBerkeley.Genomics

Interested in evolution? Primate genomics? Genome assembly? Structural variation? Check out this awesome opportunity in our lab! Incredible dataset, I'm extremely excited about this!

Postdoc position in primate genome evolution and structural variation
keywords: primate evolution; T2T genome assembly; structural variation; genomics; long read sequencing 

The Sudmant lab at UC Berkeley is seeking a postdoc to work on a fully funded NIH project to assemble and analyze a set of haplotype-resolved near-T2T genomes from 50 diverse primates species. 
This NSF/NIH EDGE funded project seeks to analyze these genome assemblies to better understand how the structures of primate genomes have evolved and responded to different selective pressures over the last several million years.
Some specific topics of interest include: characterizing lineage specific gene expansions, identifying patterns of balancing selection and ILS, and characterizing patterns of diversity, however the direction of the project is very much open to be driven by the candidate!
This project is in collaboration with Matthew Mitchell (Coriell) and Erik Garrison (UTHSC). Genome sequencing is currently ongoing using several different long-read technologies (PacBio, ONT, HiC).  

The position is fully funded (initial 24-month appointment, extendable) with a highly competitive salary scale as was recently negotiated - (https://www.science.org/content/article/postdoc-union-reaches-tentative-agreement-university-california). 

The ideal candidate will have strong computational and genetics experience. Our lab philosophy is firmly based on the premise that science should be fun, inclusive, collaborative, and open. 

Required qualifications:
Ph.D. or equivalent in genetics, genomics, biology, computer science or related fields and demonstrated record of productivity and publications. Experience with either generating or analyzing large-scale genomic data.

Please contact Peter with your CV and a brief overview of your interests. Please be prepared to provide scientific references (e.g. advisor / thesis committee members). 
The position is open until filled with an anticipated start date in late 2023 / 2024.
