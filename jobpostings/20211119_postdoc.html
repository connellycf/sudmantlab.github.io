Postdoc:UCBerkeley.Genomics

Postdoctoral position on the evolution and genetics of adapatation, speciation, and extreme life-history traits in Pacific Ocean Rockfishes. This work will follow up on our recently published work "Origins and evolution of extreme life span in Pacific Ocean rockfishes" https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg5332. A fully funded multi-year postdoctoral position is available (initial 12-month appointment). Start date is flexible within the next 6-12mo.

The Sudmant Lab at UC Berkeley is seaking a postdoc to work on the evolution of Pacific Ocean Rockfishes using genome assembly and population genetic sampling data from several species pairs. More than  120 different species of Rockfishes are found throughout the northeast and northwest Pacific Ocean and they are one of the fastest diversifying clades of rayfinned fishes. Remarkably rockfishes exhibit life spans ranging from 11 years (Sebastes minor) to >200 years (rougheye rockfish, Sebastes aleutianus). Rockfishes are thus distinctive in that while some species are among the longest-lived vertebrates known to exist, life span can widely range even among closely related taxa. 

The candidate will help lead a multi-year fully funded project to study the genetics of adapatation, speciation, and extreme life-history traits in several different recently diverged rockfish species pairs. The project is part of an international collaborative effort with the Owens' Lab at the University of Victoria and Wes Larson's Group at NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center and includes ancient rockfish genomic data being generated in collaboration with Courtney Hofman at the University of Oklahoma and Catherine West at Boston University. The candidate should have experiencee in genetics, genomics, and using computational approaches to study genetic diversity and evolution. Our lab philosophy is firmly based on the premise that science should be fun, inclusive, collaborative, and open. 

Required qualifications:
Ph.D. or equivalent in genetics, genomics, biology, computer science or related fields and demonstrated record of productivity and publications. Experience with either generating or analyzing large-scale genomic data.

Please contact Peter with your CV and a brief overview of your interests. Please be prepared to provide scientific references (e.g. advisor / thesis committee members). 
The position is open until filled with an anticipated start date in mid-2021
