Postdoc:UCBerkeley.Genomics

Postdoc position in primate genome evolution; Structural Variation; genomics; long read sequencing 

A fully funded postdoctoral position on the evolution of structural variation in humans and non-human primates is available in the Sudmant Lab at UC Berkeley. This work will focus on understanding how some of the most complex and rapidly evolving regions of the genome have changed over both recent human evolution (~300KY-present) and longer timescales (~6-50MY). Current work in the Sudmant lab is generating telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genomes for several primate species as well as population-scale long read sequencing data in both primates and humans. Alongside large-scale datasets being generated by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) new long-read technologies present an unparalleled opportunity to explore evolution of much of the genome that has previously been intractable. This includes highly divergent (and rapidly evolving) loci such as the MHC as well as structurally complex loci including sex chromosomes, segmental duplications, and centromeres. Pangenome graph-based approaches can further be used to explore the evolution of these loci in ancient human genomes. The candidate will work on their own independent projects and collaborate with other graduate students and postdocs in the lab.

The position is fully funded (initial 24-month appointment, extendable) with a highly competitive salary scale as was recently negotiated - (https://www.science.org/content/article/postdoc-union-reaches-tentative-agreement-university-california). 

The ideal candidate will have strong computational and genetics experience. Our lab philosophy is firmly based on the premise that science should be fun, inclusive, collaborative, and open. 

Required qualifications:
Ph.D. or equivalent in genetics, genomics, biology, computer science or related fields and demonstrated record of productivity and publications. Experience with either generating or analyzing large-scale genomic data.

Please contact Peter with your CV and a brief overview of your interests. Please be prepared to provide scientific references (e.g. advisor / thesis committee members). 
The position is open until filled with an anticipated start date in Sept 2023.
