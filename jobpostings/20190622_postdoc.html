Postdoctoral position(s) on the genomics and evolution of aging, genome structure, and cellular and organismal diversity

The Sudmant Lab at UC Berkeley lab uses computational, statistical, and experimental methods to interrogate genetic and molecular phenotypic diversity at both the organismal and cellular level. The objective of our research is to understand aging and genome structure in the context of cellular and organismal diversity and in the context of evolution and adaptation. We also study the evolution of cellular diversity using comparative genomics approaches. Our lab philosophy is firmly based on the premise that science should be fun, inclusive, collaborative, and open. 

A multi-year postdoctoral position is available (initial 12-month appointment renewable up to four more years). Start date is flexible. 

We are seeking both computational and experimental postdoctoral applicants with a wide range of interests and expertise, however, specific/ongoing questions/projects include:

1) The evolution of cellular diversity in mammals, particularly in rapidly evolving tissues
2) Interrogating somatic mutational processes in different cell types and genotypes throughout both healthy aging and disease
3) Structural variation, genome complexity, and diversity in vertebrates (using PacBio and other long-read technologies)
4) Quantifying the impact of aging on molecular fidelity at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level both experimentally and computationally

Please contact Peter with your CV and a brief overview of the research program / questions you are interested in pursuing in our lab as well as PDFs of recent relevent publications. Please be prepared to provide scientific references (e.g. advisor / thesis committee members). The position is open until filled with an anticipated start date in 2020.
